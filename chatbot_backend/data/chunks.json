Most baccalaureate degrees require 121 semester credit hours,\nso to complete these requirements in four years, careful planning is required.\n\nIn order to graduate with the desired degree in four years, it is imperative that students\nplan carefully and follow the guidelines in their college of enrollment, for the\nparticular degree that is being pursued. Students are encouraged to talk with their\nacademic advisor early and often about their path to completion in four years\n\nStudents should keep in mind:\n\ne For certain financial aid purposes, the federal government considers\nenrollment in 12 credit hours as full-time enrollment, but if a student limits\ntheir load to 12 hours per semester, they will not complete their degree in 4\nyears!\n\ne Dothe math - if a major requires 121 hours, and considering the 1-credit\nhour University Survey course required of everyone, 15 hours per semester\nis the minimum required credit hour load to account for the remaining 120\n\nhours!\n\ne Pay less by taking at least 15 credit hours per semester. There is no\nadditional tuition per credit hour charged for hours between 12 and 18. So if\n\nstudents take only 12 hours, they will pay for every credit hour. If they take\n15 hours, they will get three free credit hours each semester, saving them an\n\nentire year’s worth of tuition!\n\nCollege is a commitment. Earning 15 credits per semester may not be easy,\nbut it will give students the advantage of graduating on time and getting\nahead. Students should know the courses they need to graduate, and meet\nwith their advisor to map out a plan to earn their degree on time.\n\nMake school a priority. If"

If it's possible, students should cut back on work time\nso they can earn 15 credits per semester and finish faster. The payoff in their\nsalary as a college graduate will be worth it. Students should consider\nworking on campus while taking 15 credits, allowing for more flexibility in\ntheir schedule and a shorter commute time than if they work off campus.\nCheck out the Student Job Board on the Student Financial Aid website.\n\nResearch shows that students who are taking 15 credit hours actually\nperform better in their classes than those who are taking 12 hours. Research\nalso shows that students who work on campus do better than those who\nwork the same number of hours off campus.\n\nBe ready for freshman English and Math, and take these courses as part of\ntheir first year of college. Students who take 15 credits per semester and\ncomplete their English and Math courses early are more likely to graduate\non time.\n\nFill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), the application\nused by nearly all colleges and universities to determine eligibility for\nfederal, state and college-sponsored financial aid, including grants,\neducational loans and work-study programs. Some students may be eligible\nfor grants and free gift aid, which do not have to be paid back. With financial\nassistance, students can concentrate on their studies, work fewer hours and\nfinish their degree faster.\n\nBe proactive and ask for help. On campus, students are surrounded with\npeople and resources with the purpose of helping them get their degree.\nStudents should ask for help from professors, teaching assistants, academic\nadvisors and even fellow students when they need it.\n\nTake summer classes!

Students in this group typically have applicable credit for Ohio State\ncoursework through one or more of the following sources:\n\ne Credit by examination resulting from successful scores on Advanced\nPlacement (AP) or College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exams;\n\ne Credit by examination resulting from scores on foreign-language placement\n\nexams in French, German, Italian, Latin, or Spanish;\n\ne Credit for college or university coursework completed in concurrent\nenrollment during high school, including coursework completed through the\nPost-Secondary Enrollment Options Program (PSEOP), the International\nBaccalaureate (IB), or other recognized dual-enrollment programs;\n\ne Credit obtained at community colleges or technical schools, subject to\narticulation guidelines;\n\ne Credit obtained through recognized online programs;\n\ne Conversion of military training and coursework, subject to articulation\nguidelines.\n\ne Completing required course work during short sessions or summer\n\nprograms may also shorten time to degree.\n\nA large number of incoming credits, however, does not in itself guarantee a\nshorter path to a degree!\n\nThe curricular requirements of many programs are linked to the requirements and\nstandards of professional accreditation. How (and whether) a student’s credits apply to\ndegree requirements will determine the student’s time to degree. Although credits\nfrom the sources listed above will transfer to Ohio State, those credits may not help to\nfulfill the particular requirements for a specific degree. For example, though a student\nmay earn a substantial number of credits in a foreign language by satisfactory\ncompletion of the language placement test (and though satisfactory testing and the\nresulting credits in a foreign language certainly represent an admirable level of\nacademic achievement), those credits will not significantly advance progress toward a\ndegree if 1) the student’s program does not require foreign language proficiency and 2)\nthe program does not require elective course work.\n\nAnd because of sequenced courses (and course prerequisites) and the requirements for\ndisciplinary accreditation, certain programs cannot be completed in three years.

Students who choose to get involved achieve many positive outcomes - leadership\nskills, better grades, friendships and mentors, and make a big campus seem small. Use the tools\nbelow to search for, find, and get involved with student organizations.\n\nYou can also connect with many of our student organizations at our Student Involvement Fairs in\nAugust and January. Check out the Student Involvement Fairs webpage for the latest information.\n\nFor individualized assistance find the student organization that's right for you, schedule a Get Involved\nConsultation. These 30-minute meetings will provide a personalized list of recommendations based\non your interests and aspirations.\n\nPlease consult this list of student organizations with revoked registration as of Spring 2025. Some\norganizations continue to operate after their registration has been revoked despite the action taken\nby the university. We encourage you to review an organization’s status before becoming involved with\nit, especially because sometimes an organization’s status is revoked due to serious concerns like\nhazing and other behavior that risks your health and safety.\n\nBasic Search Vv\nCampus:\nColumbus v\n\nPrivacy - Terms\n\nDirectory\n\n0-9 A B C.D\n\nT UO Vi WX Y\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n1853 results found\n\nName\n\n1 Day For The K.I.A., Inc.\n\n1825 at Ohio State\nThe 1870 Fund\n\nThe 2nd and 7 Foundation\nMedical Branch\n\nG Hi | J kK LOM N\n\nZ ALL\n\nPurpose Statement\n\n1 Day for the K.I"

Regardless of whether they sign the Buckeye Honor Pledge\nor not, students are held to the Code of Student Conduct.\n\nIf a student does not sign the Buckeye Honor Pledge, this serves as an excellent\nopportunity for the instructor to engage them in conversation about the importance of\nOhio State’s Shared Values and how affirming their commitment to them serves to\nimprove the university's ethical culture.\n\nWriting out versus signing The Buckeye Honor Pledge\n\nWriting out The Buckeye Honor Pledge ensures that students spend time reflecting on\nthe words they are pledging and helps to drive home their importance. Instructors may\ndecide for themselves how they would like to include the honor pledge in their\nassignments, but we recommend using the written pledge for larger assignments and\nthe signed pledge for smaller assignments.\n\nTemplates\n\nBuckeye Honor Pledge Written Version\nBuckeye Honor Pledge Signature Version\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nOffice of Ombuds Services\nCommittee on Academic Misconduct Resources\n\nUniversity Conduct Board Resources\n\nAcademics\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nAcademic Progress to Degree\n\nBuckeye Honor Pledge\n\nGeneral Education (GE) »\nSyllabus Policies & Statements >\n\nPolicies and faculty resources\n\nTHE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY\n\nOffice of Undergraduate Education\n\n281 W.

    "text": "A Quick Guide to Burnout \n“Burnout” is a common word, but what does it really mean? How do we deal with it when it happens? \nWhat is “burnout?” \nThe Meriam-Webster Dictionary defines burnout as: “exhaustion of physical or emotional strength or \nmotivation usually as a result of prolonged stress or frustration.” \n•\nThis can be further fueled by a workload that is either unfulfilling or unstainable for a long period.\n•\nIt can lead to both physical and mental symptoms, like headaches or a lack of motivation.\nWhat can I do? \n•\nIdentifying meaning in your work - It can be easy to see homework, classes and assignments as\n“meaningless” and “busy work,” but this mindset often fuels burnout. Consider what reasons you have\nfor continuing your academic career, and why you find your major interesting or fulfilling personally.\n•\nFinding balance in daily activities - Academics is not the only important part of life. Spending time with\nfriends, exercising, relaxation and engaging in hobbies can boost our mood and help counteract feelings\nof burnout.\n•\nTake frequent, fulfilling and intentional breaks - Studying for long periods at a time usually leads to\nretaining less information and feeling mentally exhausted. Taking breaks to stretch, breathe, go outside\nor do something fun can give us renewed energy and motivation.\n•\nTake care of your basic needs - While it may feel imperative to pull an all-nighter to finish studying,\nstudies show that sleep can further cement the things we’ve learned throughout the day to memory, as\nwell as improve focus, concentration and motivation. Try not to trade sleep and food for study time.\nWhat campus resources can help me? \n•\nOn Demand Workshops - We have daily workshops on a variety of mental health topics that you can\nstop in any time you want to. Find more information about workshops online.\n•\nLet’s Talk Appointments - These are 20-minute consultations with a mental health professional about\nany topic you want quick feedback about, including burnout. Details about Let's Talk appointments are\navailable online.\n•\nWellness Coaching -"

While this work occurs, language referencing protected\nclass status or other activities prohibited by Ohio Senate Bill 1 may still appear in some\nplaces. However, all programs and activities will be administered in compliance with the\nlaw as of June 27, 2025.\n\nOffice of Student Life\nBuckeye Careers\n\nHH\nfe)\n\nInternships\n\nBuckeye Careers and Internships\n\nStudent Life Buckeye Careers works to support students and their career preparation through the\nestablishment of internships. One of our missions is to consult with employers in order to create\ninternship and co-ops opportunities. We work closely with the college career offices to build the\nmost wide-ranging, robust and fulfilling opportunities for our Ohio State students.\n\nWhat is an internship?\n\nInternships are characterized by the following:\n\n1. Adefined start and end date\n\n2. Clearly defined project-based learning objectives and goals that align with the student's\nacademic pursuits\n\n3. Supervision and regular performance feedback by a professional with education and\nexpertise in the field\n\nInternships can be paid or unpaid, and credit bearing or non-credit bearing.\n\nWhy should students look for an internship\nNOW?\n\nInternships provide students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make\nconnections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. They give employers the\nopportunity to guide and evaluate talent, as well as potential new hires with experience in their\ncompany once the student graduates. Students will gain a better understanding of a specific\ncompany or industry and the possibility of the industry to be a longer term career fit. In short, an\ninternship will put students in a better position to land and succeed in the job market.\n\nResearch shows that students who participate in internships and co-ops complete college at higher\nrates than those who do not, are better prepared for the workplace and are better paid. The\naverage offer rate for students that participate in internships for full-time opportunities is 73%, and\nthe average hourly wage for interns seeking a bachelor’s degree is $17.50.\n\nOne"

The student can learn first-hand about their chosen profession by asking questions about\ntasks, business environment and educational background. Here are some questions a\n\nstudent might ask:\n\nWhat is your typical workday like?\n\nWhat do you like most (and least) about your job?\n\nWhat skills/abilities are most important to succeed in this job?\n\nWhat is your educational background?\n\nHow did you get started in this field?\n\nWhat courses were most helpful to you and which would you recommend?\nWhat is the best way to get started in this field?\n\nDo you have any additional advice to help me prepare?\n\nFinding an Internship\n\nHandshake is an intuitive, easy-to-use job search system to help students connect with employers\nfor part-time jobs, internships, co-ops and full-time career opportunities. Handshake is accessible\nto students using their name.# and password to log in. Students should complete their profile so\nthat they can start taking advantage of everything Handshake has to offer: job searching, resume\nreview, career events, career fairs, employer reviews and much more.\n\nIf a student is considering an unpaid internship, they should familiarize themselves with Fair Labor\nStandards Act guidelines\n\nThere are many other ways to find an internship. Several are outlined below:\n\nUtilize personal networks\n\nMeet with a staff member in a college career services office\n\nMeet with staff in Buckeye Careers\n\nFind on-campus career and internship fair events on Handshake\n\nFind opportunities state-wide at the Ohio Means Internships & Co-ops\n\nAre you looking for an internship, or something\nsimilar?\n\nBelow are definitions of some other opportunities commonly used to explore your potential career:\n\nExperiential Learning - a process through which students develop knowledge, skills and\nvalues from direct experiences outside a traditional academic setting.

The typical program plan is for a student to alternate\nterms of full-time classroom study with terms of full-time, employment. Since program\nparticipation involves multiple work terms, the student will work three or four work terms,\ngaining a year or more of career-related work experience before graduation. Most co-op\npositions are paid and acquiring academic credit.\n\nPracticum - is generally a one-time work or service experience done by a student as part of\nan academic class. Some practicums offer pay, but many do not. Almost all are done for\nacademic credit.\n\nExternship/Job Shadow - a short (usually 1-5 days) working experience, where the student\nshadows a working professional to observe and get a preview of the day-to-day activities\nneeded for the career. Externships and job shadowing experiences are generally unpaid and\nare not related to receiving academic credit.\n\nMicro-Internship - a short-term, professional experience that will typically last just a few\nweeks for the duration of a single project. Typically these experiences are conducted\nremotely and can be from 5 to 40 hours per week. Such opportunites can be found on Parker\n\nDewey.\n\nSummer Internship Housing\n\nThe Ohio State University Events and Conferences offers a unique 12-week summer housing\nprogram for interns, researchers, and other guests from Mid-May through the beginning of August.\nParticipants do not need to be an Ohio State University student to enroll in our Summer Intern\nHousing Program. In fact, that is why this program exists, to offer affordable, short term housing for\nstudents across the world to support their learning at an internship and to support the students of\nOSU and their internships.\n\nQuestions about internships?\n\nIf you have a question about internships, contact Buckeye Careers at careerquestions@osu.edu.\n\n8 THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY\nOFFICE OF STUDENT LIFE\n\nBuckeye Careers - Office of Student Life\n\nEngage.

The SI] Leader shadows\ncourse lectures to understand how students are currently receiving\ninformation, and tailors their sessions accordingly.\n\nSl is a research-based active learning approach consistent with some of the\nbest practices for academic success. Students who regularly attend Sl\nsessions earn better grades, develop a greater understanding of the course\nmaterial and learn more effective ways to study. Additionally, they develop\nrelationships with peers and cultivate a network of support. SI session\nattendance is not mandatory, and students may begin attending at any point\nin the semester. Note: The greatest benefit is derived from regular attendance\nand active participation.\n\nIf an OUE Scholar is enrolled in an Sl-offered course, they will be\nautomatically enrolled in a Carmen group at the beginning of each semester.\n\nVv S-SAS Scholarship Services\n\nThe mission of our Scholarship Services unit is to help students maximize\ntheir financial aid opportunities and reduce indebtedness.\n\nThe Office of Outreach and Engagement offers resources and individual\nguidance on financial aid and scholarships to students registered in the\nfollowing programs: ACCESS Collaborative, James L.

While course syllabi may vary in\n\nformat and content, there is a culture that has been established around the\n\nexpectations associated with this important document.\n\nThe purpose of the syllabus should drive the instructor’s decisions regarding what\n\ncontent to include (Parkes & Harris, 2002)*. As instructors design their syllabus, they\n\nmay reflect on three broad purposes that a syllabus can serve:\n\n1.\n\nThe Syllabus as a guide: It sets forth what is expected to happen during the\nterm of the course; it delineates the responsibilities of students and of the\ncourse instructor; and it describes appropriate rules, procedures and course\npolicies.\n\nThe Syllabus as a permanent record: It serves accountability and\ndocumentation functions related to the course"

From your first class to your final\nwalk across the graduation stage, you'll be surrounded by a supportive community, world-class\nfaculty, and endless opportunities to explore your passions. Every step is designed to help you\ngrow academically, personally, and professionally.\n\n“The journey of a thousand miles begins with\none step.”\n\nLao Tzu, ancient Chinese philosopher and writer\n\nPlanning for your journey\n\nThere are a lot of questions that come up while planning for your college experience. Ohio State\nhas offices spread out across six campuses that provide resources. If you haven't already, make\nsure to visit Undergraduate Admissions, which will help you start to put the pieces into place\nto build a solid plan.\n\nThere are some opportunities at Ohio State that you can sign up for before starting on campus.\nMost people are aware of the Honors program and its benefits, but the Scholars programs\noffer a unique and diverse range of opportunities that can make a big university feel more\npersonal. And the ROTC programs at Ohio State are first class and make college more\naffordable. Did you know that Ohio State has Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC? We're one of\nonly 50 or so universities and colleges who have all three programs.\n\nAnd starting at Ohio State doesn't just mean here in Columbus. We have students starting their\njourney at campuses across the state. Our regional campuses offer the same world-class\neducation and amazing faculty, but with a lower barrier for entry. The students in Lima,\nNewark, Mansfield, Marion, and Wooster love their campuses and are proud to be Buckeyes.\nThey graduate with the same university name on their diploma as students who graduate from\nthe"

Plus, should you decide to transfer and work toward a degree that is\nonly available at the Columbus campus, the campus change process smooths the way,\n\nrecognizing the fact that students from regional campuses have been Buckeyes since day one.\n\nTaking off\n\nThe path that brings a student to Ohio State is unique to each individual. The typical image of\nan undergraduate student is an 18-22-year-old, who starts right after graduating from high\nschool. But that is only a portion of our undergraduate student population. Students transfer to\nOhio State from other schools across the state, nation, and world. We have students who are\nstarting or returning after taking time to start a career or a family. We're proud to welcome our\nveterans and active duty military and their families.\n\nOhio State has an amazing orientation program, which will walk you and your family through\nthe necessary steps to get started, and a First Year Experience program, which provides\nsupport throughout your first year as a Buckeye. Our campuses in Lima, Mansfield, Marion,\nNewark, and the Agricultural Technical Institute in Wooster offer their own orientation\nprograms specifically tailored for their campuses.\n\nAt orientation, one of the people you'll meet with is an advisor. Think of an advisor as your\ncollege navigation system. They can provide the information and options that help you plan the\nbest path to your destination, and warn you of potential hazards along the way. Make sure you\nset your preferences with them so they offer the best advice for you. Are you okay with taking\nthe scenic route if it offers a better journey? Do you want to avoid certain paths? Are you\nlooking for the quickest way to your destination?\n\nAnother resource to be aware of is University Exploration, which has advisors who are trained\nto help you figure out what you want to be when you grow up. Or help you discover a new plan\nif you find that the what you decided to be in middle school doesn't fit you any more. Contrary\nto popular belief, it's okay"

Contrary\nto popular belief, it's okay to come to college as undecided, and these are the people who help\nyou make that work without wasting time and money.\n\nKeep it moving\n\nProgress toward a degree is a journey that requires careful planning and attention. Even the\nbest laid plans may encounter unexpected delays or require detours. Keep checking in with\nyour advisor. Your navigation system is only any good if you pay attention to it. You need to\nmake sure that you're getting up-to-date information.

Your coursework will fit into\nthree buckets: General Education (GE)\ncourses, your major coursework, and\nelectives. GEs are the backbone of your\neducation. They teach you how to think\ncritically, communicate effectively, and\nbecome a life-long learner. Your major\ncoursework gives you expertise in your\n\nfield of study. In addition to preparing you\nfor the workforce, this also gives you\ntheoritical foundation to advance beyond that first job. And electives allow you to take\nadvantage of the wealth of knowledge made available at Ohio State. It lets you keep singing\neven if you don’t plan to major in vocal performance and let’s the future electrical engineer\nlearn more about military history.\n\nAnd keep your eyes open, as new opportunities are everywhere. Did you know that as an\nundergraduate you can work on research projects? It's great experience for your resume, let's\nyou connect with faculty and graduate students outside of the classroom environment, and\nopens you up to fields of interest you never knew you wanted to pursue. How about extending\nyour learning outside of the classroom? Try a service-learning course, which combines the\nbest of active learning and citizenship by connecting course content with service projects that\nhelp the community.

Consult your academic advisor to\ndetermine if/how this type of credit will apply toward your degree\nrequirements before making a financial commitment to the program. Be sure\nto consider potential program costs and funding sources.\n\nBefore applying, consider the following features:\n\ne Does the program offer a comprehensive website? You should be\nable to access a thorough program overview, host city/country\ninformation, staff contacts, current information on travel dates and\ncosts, application submission instructions, course descriptions and\nalumni feedback.\n\ne Does the program offer pre-departure services?

The\norganization’s leadership should submit a group travel registration 90 days in\nadvance of your travel. Details can be found on the travel registration page.\n\nIf your organization is seeking a program provider for your experience or is\nlooking to vet a service experience, the Office of International Affairs\nencourages you to use the resources of the International Volunteer Programs\nAssociation (IVPA) to determine if the experience is the right fit for you.\nReview this guide to the types of questions to ask any organization seeking\nto recruit you and identifying a reliable program. IVPA also has a membership\ndirectory of organizations that meet the principles and practices outlined in\nthe links above.\n\nConsider the following features:\n\ne Does the program offer a comprehensive website? You should be\nable to access a thorough program overview, host city/country\ninformation, staff contacts, current information on travel dates and\ncosts, application submission instructions, relevant course\ndescriptions and alumni feedback.\n\ne Does the program offer pre-departure services? These may include\nresponsive and accessible staff, advising services, visa assistance\n(if applicable) and comprehensive orientation materials.\n\ne Does the program offer in-country services? These may include on-\nsite staff to provide airport pick-up (or assistance) and housing\nplacement, as well as 24/7 emergency and day-to-day support.\n\nAfter acceptance, prepare for your responsibilities:\n\ne = All Ohio State students pursuing registered student organization\ntravel abroad are required to adhere to the"

It is well-documented that education abroad\nfosters increased self-confidence, a high tolerance for ambiguity and\nintercultural development. Research shows that future employers look\nfavorably upon such experiences. While virtual exchange is a newer way of\nglobal engagement, it provides project-based opportunities for peer-to-peer\n\ninteractions across cultural boundaries, building new intercultural skills and\nknowledge. Global online learning opens opportunities in and to locations\nwhere travel may not be possible due to health or safety concerns.\n\nWhat opportunities exist?\n\nSimilar to education abroad programs, global online experiences can vary in\nstructure and length of time. In some cases, students collaborate through a\ncourse experience and/or project with students from a partner institution or\norganization. In other cases, a faculty member leads a course with virtual\ninternational lecturers and online community engagements. Students can also\nparticipate in online global courses through approved third-party providers or\ngain valuable skills by participating in a virtual internship.\n\nGlobal Education\n\nExplore Programs\n\nGetting Started \\\n\nGetting Started Sessions\nWays to Go Abroad\nChoosing a Program\nGetting Started Academics\nFunding\nAccommodations and Disabilities\nApplication and Policies >\n\nPreparing to Depart »\n\nHealth and Safety\n\nComing Home\n\nPlanning a Program\n\nFAQ\n\nTHE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY\n\nOffice of International Affairs\n140 Enarson Classroom Building\n2009 Millikin Rd\n\nColumbus, OH 43210\n\nola@osu.edu\n\nPhone: 614-292-6101\n\nAbout Us\nDirectory\nEvents\nGive\nForms\nNews\n\nX f in @ Q\n\nIf you have a disability and experience difficulty accessing this content,\nplease contact the Digital Accessibility Center for assistance at\naccessibility@osu.edu or 614-292-1760.\n\nPrivacy Statement\nNon-discrimination Notice\nCookie Settings\n\n© 2025 The"

If we want to\nkeep students engaged, we have to not only provide the kind of educational experience\nthat will prepare them for a life in their careers, but we need to respond to this\nincreased awareness and preparation and reflect that in the way we engage with them.\n\nThe Office of Undergraduate Education strives to provide an enriching academic\nexperience for all undergraduate students, which contributes to the recognition of The\nOhio State University as one of the preeminent institutions of higher education in the\n\ncountry.
